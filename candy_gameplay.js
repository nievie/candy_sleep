// Probability Part I :

// Probability is always between 0 and 1

// Probability of an event happening =   Number of ways it can happen / Total number of outcomes

// Steps to find the probability:

// Step 1: List the outcomes of the experiment.

// Step 2: Count the number of possible outcomes of the experiment.

// Step 3: Count the number of favorable outcomes.

// Step 4: Use the probability formula.


// If P(A) > P(B) then event A is more likely to occur than event B.
// If P(A) = P(B) then events A and B are equally likely to occur.


// There are 9 spaces in a row
// There are 7 possible combinations of 3 
// so in 1 row, there are 7 possible group of spaces where three of a kind could fall
// The probability of a three of a kind is 1/7 or .142857143

// There are 9 spaces
// There are 4 possible colors
// The probability for a color landing in any space is 1/4 or .25
// The probability of all spaces being the same color is the probability of a color multiplied 
// by itself for each recurring instance in the series.  So  .25^9 = 0.000003815


// 9 rows 

// 7*9 = 63

// 7 combinations of 3 per column
// 9 columns

// 7*9 = 63
